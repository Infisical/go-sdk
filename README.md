## Introduction

**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their secrets like API keys, database credentials, and configurations.

If you’re working with Go, the official Infisical Go SDK package is the easiest way to fetch and work with secrets for your application. You can read the documentation [here](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/go).

## Documentation
You can find the documentation for the Go SDK on our [SDK documentation page](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/go).
